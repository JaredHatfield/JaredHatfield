👋 I’m Jared Hatfield, an application architect with a passion for designing and implementing scalable applications.
While my personal GitHub projects may not be very active, I maintain and support a number of projects over at [UnitVectorY Labs](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs).
You can also check out the published projects on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.unitvectory) as well as [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/UnitVectorY-Labs/packages).

I tend to specialize in Java development, with extensive experience in AWS and more recently, GCP.
However, I try to stay well rounded though always digging into the latest technology.
